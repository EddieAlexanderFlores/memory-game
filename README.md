# memory-game
Simple memory game with JavaScript. 

I took this tutorial from Ania Kubow: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhNdUVh3qCc&t=744s 

I made some changes to the code to experiment with it.

## Rules:
* You will start by flipping over one card.
* If the next card you flip matches, you get +1 to your score. These cards then dissapear.
* If the next card you flip does not match, the cards flip back.
* The game continues until you match all the cards on the board.
